# Team Portfolio Generator

## Description
I wanted a backend application that allows a software engineering team to make a portfolio of their employees, with their contact information, so that everyone's titles and info would be in one place. I developed it using Node.js and Jest to run tests. The most challenging aspect was generating the HTML to include the data in my array that saved user's input to questions about the employees.
